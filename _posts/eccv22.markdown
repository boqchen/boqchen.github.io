A novel multiple instance learning (MIL) method, which learns to perform multi-level differentiable zooming in histopathology Whole-Slide Images (WSIs). It can be trained end-to-end to aggregate context information across multiple scales for image classification while significantly reducing computational efforts, i.e., run-time and floating-point operations.
