We introduce a new spatiotemporal benchmark on 3D point cloud registration under large geometric change across temporal stages. Current spatiotemporal scene understanding methods and data focus on object relocation and do not tackle disruptive change in the built environment, such as that on the geometry and topology of objects. To encourage work on this front, we define NSS on a new dataset that contains recurrent 3D point cloud captures of large-scale building indoors under construction and renovation, since these are the building lifecycle phases that present the most drastic change over time. The benchmark tasks are designed to evaluate spatiotemporal 3D registration on three scenarios of increasing difficulty, with the goal to evaluate not only over pairs from the same stage, but also across stages and across buildings. In addition to pairwise registration of input point cloud patches, we assess the global registration of patches that belong to the same building and stage. We evaluate state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark and demonstrate the need for approaches that are specifically designed for large spatiotemporal changes.
